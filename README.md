# snake_game
OOP implimentation of the classic game, including scene management. Includes an "AI" snake option using Breadth First Search for basic pathfinding.

TODO: Fix bug in BFS Snake sometimes going back on itself after first apple; User input to define Player/AI snake, better obstacles/wall management (currently hardcoded to some positions I randomly chose).
