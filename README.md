# snake_game
OOP implimentation of the classic game, including scene management. Includes an "AI" snake option using Breadth First Search for basic pathfinding.

TODO: 
BUGS: Fix bug in BFS Snake sometimes going back on itself after first apple.

FEATURES: A* Pathfinding; difficulty (speed, configurable walls).

CODING: Type hinting (would have saved a lot of pain originally), tidy up Objects and how they pass to one-another (not the most elegant or scalable).
